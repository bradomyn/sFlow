White Rabbit Switch sFlow v1.0, based on sFlow v 5

Author:     Cesar Prados (c.prados@gsi.de) 

Short info: Implementation of the White Rabbit Switch sFlow Network Traffic Mmonitor
            The sFlow daemon follows the api and data structures proposed by the 
            sFlow consortium.


		sFlow Agent README
		==================


netsflow.h      - data structure of networking sFlow configuration



doesn't exist yet, they should be in case we want host and applications 
configuration and values in sFlow

hostsflow.h      - data structure of host sFlow configuration

appsflow.h      - data structure of app sFlow configuration


//TO MODIFY, BELOW


sflow_api.h		- include file for sflow agent library.  All the
	        	  external calls and callbacks are declared here.

sflow.h			- structure definitions for the sflow sample packet.

sflow_agent.C		- Agent object. Normally one per switch/router, but
			  "agentSubId" can be used to distinguish multiple
			  agents representing different parts of the same device.

sflow_sampler.C		- Sampler object (one per interface/vlan).
			  If implementing the SNMP MIB, then there will be
			  one of these for each row in the SNMP table. Usually
			  all the Samplers are created and given to the
			  Agent at initialization time.

sflow_poller.C		- Sampler object (one per interface/vlan).
			  If implementing the SNMP MIB, then there will be
			  one of these for each row in the SNMP table. Usually
			  all the Samplers are created and given to the
			  Agent at initialization time.

sflow_receiver.C	- Receiver object.  Usually created at startup as a list
			  of available "slots" coressponding to rows in the receiver
			  table of the MIB.

sflsp.C			- Example program. Implements a rudimentary Sflow
			  Agent using the libpcap packet capture library
			  (see tcpdump(1)).

Makefile		- Makefile for builing sflsp program.
