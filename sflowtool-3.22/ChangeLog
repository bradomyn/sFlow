Oct-17-2002
	2.3 bugfixes to counter value reporting
Oct-8-2002
	2.2 bugfixes to SNAP and IP decodes (thanks to Marc Lavine of Foundry Networks)

	2.0 support for sFlow version 4 datagram (RFC 3176)
May-16-2002
	1.5 allow compiling with -DSPOOFSOURCE, which then enables the "-S" flag, to spoof the source
	address of netflow packets to match the IP address of the original sflow agent. Note that this
	is only necessary for netflow output. In the case of sFlow output there is a separate field for
	the agent IP address, so the receiver can always read it from there.
May-3-2002

            + netflow v5 export, bytes counted from start of ipv4 header.
